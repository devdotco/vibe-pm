/**
 * The cross-module link contract.
 *
 * One question, asked of every module: *what do you hold that belongs to this
 * person?* — and its manual counterpart, *search your records*. CRM asks; the
 * modules answer. Nothing here flows the other way, which is the point: Sign
 * does not learn what a CRM contact is, PM does not learn what a deal is, and
 * the association lives in CRM alone.
 *
 * Defined in the shared package rather than in CRM because five modules
 * implement it. A contract that lives inside its only caller is a contract
 * every implementer copies slightly differently.
 *
 * THE ENDPOINT. Each module serves `GET /api/module-links` under its own mount:
 *
 *   ?email=<address>   records involving that person
 *   ?q=<query>         records matching a search, for manual attach
 *
 * Called SERVER-side with the caller's shell session cookie forwarded, exactly
 * as `/api/shell/nav` is. The module scopes the answer to the organisation that
 * cookie belongs to, so a module never has to be told which tenant is asking —
 * and cannot be lied to about it.
 *
 * MODULES ON ANOTHER ORIGIN cannot be reached that way. Portal's staff cookie
 * is host-scoped to portal.erp.io on purpose — a suite-wide cookie is what
 * once collided with the shell's and signed people out of everything — so the
 * header CRM forwards simply does not contain it. Those modules are given a
 * short-lived Ed25519 hand-off token from the shell instead. That is still a
 * proof rather than an assertion: the shell signs it, the module verifies the
 * signature and the audience, and CRM only carries it.
